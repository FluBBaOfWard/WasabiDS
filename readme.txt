Wasabi V1.0
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is a Watara Supervision emulator for the GBA.
It's slow, no sound and is not tested well.
This is probably the only release ever as the system/games/docs are crap.

Pogoshell:
It must be used as a Pogoshell plugin, first copy "Wasabi.gba" to the
plugin folder then rename it to "sv.bin". It can also be used as a mb-plugin
in Pogo2 by renaming it to wasabi.mb or compressed with the dcmp tools
included in Pogo2 and be renamed wasabi.mbz.


Make sure your flashing software allocates 64kByte/512kbit SRAM for Wasabi.

Press L+R to open the menu, A to choose, B (or L+R again) to cancel.

Quick load:  R+START loads the last savestate.
Quick save:  R+SELECT saves to the last savestate.

Speed modes:  L+START switches between throttled/unthrottled/slomo mode.
Sleep:  START+SELECT wakes up from sleep mode (activated from menu or 5/10/30
minutes of inactivity)

probably never have been made.
