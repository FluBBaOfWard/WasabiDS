# Wasabi V0.2.0

<img align="right" width="220" src="./logo.png" />

This is a Watara/QuickShot Supervision emulator for the Nintendo DS.

## How to use:

1. Create a folder named "wasabi" in either the root of your flash card or in the data folder.
This is where settings and save files end up.
2. Now put game/bios files into a folder where you have (Supervision) roms.
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
up the menu.
Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A or double tap
to select an option, B or the top of the screen to go back a step.

To select between the tabs use R & L or the touchscreen.
