This is a Watara/QuickShot Supervision emulator for the Nintendo DS.

## How to use

1. Create a folder named "wasabi" in either the root of your flash card or in the data folder.
This is where settings and save files end up.
2. Now put game files into a folder where you have (Supervision) roms.
3. Depending on your flashcart you might have to DLDI patch the emulator.

When the emulator starts, you can either press L+R or tap on the screen to open
up the menu.
Now you can use the cross or touchscreen to navigate the menus, A or double tap
